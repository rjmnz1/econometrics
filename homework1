SOMETHING INTERESTING
One interesting finding from the Household Pulse data is that women consistently report higher levels of anxiety and 
depression compared to men, even when controlling for age. This stood out to me because while it is known that 
the pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health, the degree of difference between genders was more 
pronounced than I expected. The combination of economic strain and mental health challenges paints a picture of vulnerability 
that goes beyond what I initially anticipated when simply looking at averages like age.


QUESTIONS 
How do employment income losses differ between men and women?
Are younger workers more likely to report job loss compared to older workers?
