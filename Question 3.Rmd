## Graph 1 – “Average Feeling Down by Education Level”:
This bar chart shows the mean level of feeling down for each education category. It visually highlights that individuals with higher education levels (college or above) tend to report lower average feelings of sadness or depression compared to those with less education.

## Graph 2 – “Distribution of Feeling Down by Gender”:
This graph uses grouped bars to show how responses differ between men and women for each “feeling down” category. It makes it easy to see if one gender reports higher emotional distress across all response levels.

## Graph 3 – “Feeling Down by Income and Gender”:
This scatterplot with a regression line shows how income relates to feeling down, with gender color-coded. You can quickly see that emotional distress tends to decrease as income increases, and whether the pattern differs between men and women.






##Each graph could be paired with a different hypothesis test.  For Graph 1 (Education vs Feeling Down), a one-way ANOVA would test whether the average level of feeling down differs across education levels. For Graph 2 (Gender vs Feeling Down), a chi-square test of independence would test whether gender and feeling down are related. For Graph 3 (Income vs Feeling Down), a linear regression would test whether income significantly predicts how often someone feels down.
